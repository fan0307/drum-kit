<p>
Keys here represent different drums in a typical drum set. And when you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And you can also use the keys on the keyboard.
Let's play pretty cool rhythms!

(* add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes so that I'll know when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a button and I can respond to it*)
